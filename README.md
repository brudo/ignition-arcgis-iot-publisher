# ignition-arcgis-iot-publisher
A utility, runnable as an unattended scheduled batch job, to perform queries against a Google BigQuery data source e.g. the Geotab Ignition datasets with authorized credentials, and upload the results to a corresponding ArcGIS Online, ArcGIS Server, or Analytics for IoT based Feature Sersices, supporting an incremental append mode, using a per-track increasing-value field (e.g. a message timestamp) as the reference point and ignoring older records. For datasets of a larger volume or closer to real-time nature, e.g. aggregated hourly border crossings, the new records can also be delivered to ArcGIS Analytics for IoT via a secure MQTT data feed (credentials required).
